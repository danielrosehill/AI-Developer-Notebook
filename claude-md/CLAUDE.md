This is the base level of the 'notes from AI' notebook.

This folder is an Obsidian notebook which contains notes for the user (Daniel) generated by AI tools. 

Spercifically - this notebook is used to contain reference material such as configurations, how-to guides, etc. 

## Style Guide

- You do not need to refer to Daniel by name but the documentation should be written with the above context in mind: it's for the user's reference.

- Aim for guides that are easy to follow but detailed

- Write the documents in Obsidian-safe markdown 

- Organisation is key: create folders and subfolders to organise topics by theme 

- Provide code blocks within code fences (always)

- Never use emojis

- Use section headers

Your overall aim: writing clear to follow technical docs for Daniel's projects that he can reference later.
