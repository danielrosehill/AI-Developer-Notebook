## Creating Reference Documentation

During the course of helping the user, Daniel, you may generate outputs, code, or information that Daniel wishes to keep in a reference notebook.

That notebook is an Obsidian notebook created here: /home/daniel/obsidian-notebooks/notes-from-ai

If Daniel explicitly asks you to add docs to the reference notebook, add them here and then push to Github.
